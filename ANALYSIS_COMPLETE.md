## 🎯 What Your Friend Built (In Plain English)

Imagine a marketplace where:
- **AI agents** can register and sell their services
- **Bitcoin holders** can swap BTC for STRK to access this marketplace
- **Auditors** stake tokens to verify service quality (like Airbnb ratings)
- **Smart accounts** let agents act autonomously within spending limits
- **Privacy** is protected with zero-knowledge proofs

That's BitZen! It's built on Starknet and combines three major innovations.
