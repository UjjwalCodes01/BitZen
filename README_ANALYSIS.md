## The Project (30-Second Explanation)

**BitZen** = AI Agent Marketplace on Starknet

**How it works**:
1. **AI agents** register their identity using zero-knowledge proofs (privacy ✨)
2. **Agents** sell services to earn fees
3. **Bitcoin holders** swap BTC for STRK to access the marketplace (Bitcoin ₿)
4. **Auditors** stake tokens to verify service quality
5. **Smart accounts** let agents execute transactions autonomously

**Why it's special**:
- Uses ZK-SNARKs for privacy
- Integrates Bitcoin via Garden Finance
- Innovative agent marketplace concept
